# Brainstorming

This file is used to document your thoughts, approaches and research conducted across all tasks in the Technical Assessment.

## Firmware

## Spyder

* Invalid data was removed. I choose to simply just ignore it to save time but you could probably log it to a file or somewhere if you wanted a record of it.
* The connection in the useEffect array was missing the dependency variable.
* Shadcn components were used as the frontend is already using it.
* The recommended helper function and global var/colours were used for the task as stated.
* A live chart has been added to display the last 6 most recent readings. Hover over the chart to see individual reading figures.
* Dark-Light mode has been done (single click toggle for ease of use).
* Sonner/Toasts will display a warning message when the predefined spec conditions are breached (same as the backend task).
